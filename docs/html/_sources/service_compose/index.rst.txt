Compose services description
============================

How to compose a service description of a Data Mining / Machine Learning.

Composing the description of a service consists of creating a service definition within a RDF/TURTLE/JSON-LD file

The description of a data mining service is performed taking into account several parts necessary for the definition of the particular service. 

These are the following:

* base information of the algorithm,
* authentication,
* input parameters corresponding to the DataSet or characteristics,
* the additional input parameters, ie the operating parameters of the mining method,
* the output of the algorithm / method that can be a model, an evaluation of the model or a DataSet,
* indicate how the method is executed; In this case it is necessary to indicate the type of implementation that is executed, whenever possible.
